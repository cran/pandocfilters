Description: The document converter 'pandoc' <https://pandoc.org/> is widely used
    in the R community. One feature of 'pandoc' is that it can produce and consume
    JSON-formatted abstract syntax trees (AST). This allows to transform a given
    source document into JSON-formatted AST, alter it by so called filters and pass
    the altered JSON-formatted AST back to 'pandoc'. This package provides functions
    which allow to write such filters in native R code. 
    Although this package is inspired by the Python package 'pandocfilters' 
    <https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/>, it provides additional convenience functions which make it simple to use the 'pandocfilters' package as a 
    report generator. Since 'pandocfilters' inherits most of it's functionality
    from 'pandoc' it can create documents in many formats 
    (for more information see <https://pandoc.org/>) but is also bound to the same
    limitations as 'pandoc'.
